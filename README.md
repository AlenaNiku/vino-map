Map of the most beautiful wineries in America
## Welcome to Vino map!
Vino map is an interactive map of the most beautiful and delicious wineries in America. Created with Mapbox - an American provider of custom online maps for websites and applications such as Foursquare, Lonely Planet, Facebook, the Financial Times, The Weather Channel and Snapchat. </br>
This app was built for my first ever hackathon in under 4 hours and it brought me 3rd place!</br>
This Hackathon was organized by Mintbean - a software developer talent incubator. </br>
