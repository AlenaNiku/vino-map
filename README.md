Map of the most beautiful wineries in America
## Welcome to Vino map!
Vino map is an interactive map of the most beautiful and delicious wineries in America. Created with Mapbox - an American provider of custom online maps for websites and applications such as Foursquare, Lonely Planet, Facebook, the Financial Times, The Weather Channel and Snapchat.
This app was built for my first ever hackathon in under 4 hours and it brought me 3rd place! This Hackathon was organized by Mintbean - a software developer talent incubator. Learn more here https://www.mintbean.io/
